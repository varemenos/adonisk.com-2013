			| Codemagic.gr is a powerful online code editor for web development! It's open-source and it follows the philosophy of client-side and fast execution. It's built for creative people who do a lot of web-related experiments and want to test stuff in real-time without the hassle of preparing project files and whatnot. It is also a great place for people to come and learn various web-technologies like HTML, CSS, JS and their derivatives.
